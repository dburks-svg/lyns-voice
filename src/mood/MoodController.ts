/**
 * Eases the avatar's color/glow toward the current mood. The AvatarController
 * consumes this through the small `MoodLayer` interface: each frame it asks the
 * mood layer to tint the activity color and adjust the glow. Motion stays owned
 * by the activity state; mood only tints.
 *
 * A `neutral` mood has weight 0, so `colors()` returns the activity color
 * unchanged and `glow()` returns the activity glow unchanged: with no mood (or a
 * neutral mood) the avatar looks exactly as it did before moods existed.
